## 🌟 Project Description

The “de/da” clitic in Turkish is a conjunction when it is written separately and has the same meaning as "as well", "too", and "also" in English. In addition to being a conjunction, the “de” and “da” homonyms may be used as locative suffixes meaning “at” or “in”. For example, the word “araba” (car) with the suffix “-da” (“arabada”) means “in the car”. Although the “de/da” clitic in the meaning of conjunction must always be written separately, it is commonly confused with the locative suffix "de/da" and incorrectly written concatenated to the previous word. This project focuses on a common spelling error in Turkish, namely the spelling of the “de/da” and "ki" clitics.
